\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) provides an overview of the software requirements for the Smart City Environmental Monitoring and Alert System (SCEMAS). SCEMAS is a software application designed to collect, analyze, and visualize environmental data such as air quality, temperature, humidity, and noise levels to support city-level monitoring and decision-making.



\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
This document outlines the system’s purpose, scope, characteristics of intended users, and the 
functional and non-functional requirements that guide the design and development of the system.
\\\\This document is intended for internal SCEMAS stakeholders, including but not limited to project managers, developers, domain experts, and SCEMAS team members/investors. No prior readings are required.
% End SubSection

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
% Begin SubSection
Smart City Environmental Monitoring and Alert System (SCEMAS) is an environmental monitoring 
software system that allows users to quickly and easily monitor environmental data for metrics 
such as air quality, noise levels, temperature, UV levels, and humidity across geographical 
zones, as well as configure alerts and reminders.\\\\
The software products in the system include a dashboard for real-time data visualization of 
active alerts and geographical maps of sensor locations. Real-time data aggregation will be 
performed within geographical zones to transform data into actionable insights for time-sensitive 
alerts in the system. A read-only REST API for non-sensitive data will be publicly available 
for any user, which uses HTTP methods to ensure safe access and rate limiting to prevent abuse 
and security threats. The system will use MQTT for transmitting all sensor telemetry securely 
through encryption, validating incoming messages for correct format, adherence to the defined 
scheme and validating value ranges. The telemetry stored in a time-series database will not 
store or process PII. Audit log history of all significant events, alert triggers and user 
management will be stored for a minimum of 1 year.\\\\
The system will have role-based access control, which will authorize user-specific access to 
data based on a user’s predefined role: City Operator and System Administrator. The operators 
will primarily use the application to monitor environmental conditions, view raised alerts and 
respond to events quickly using in-app tools. Operators will have write access to change event 
statuses and create alert rules. Administrators will have elevated privileges to approve and 
verify any alert rules being made based on specific thresholds or historical data trends.\\\\
SCEMAS will have a separate public facing dashboard interface that will allow any public user 
to view the visualized non-sensitive data from the REST API.\\\\
Our software will have Service Level Agreements (SLA) to guarantee a dashboard response time 
of 30 seconds upon logging in. A goal of the software is to increase the number of public users 
accessing the REST API to improve data quality and product development.

\section{Overall Product Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
SCEMAS is a smart city monitoring dashboard developed for environmental monitoring of the 
average smart city built for a web application. Related products include Siemens MindSphere, 
AxxonSoft (Safe City) and Cisco Kinetic for Cities, where city-wide data is monitored from 
various IoT devices based on geographic zones. However SCEMAS differentiates itself by 
focusing on unifying all environmental data into one centralized dashboard and database 
with the ability to respond to events via built-in tools rather than just observing them. 
The product will facilitate various roles of access, allowing users to be created, edited, 
and removed, while keeping extensive historical logs of all user actions, alerts, and 
collected data for auditing similar to the compliance standards found in the related 
products. Various alerts and reminders can be created based on geographical zones and 
real-time aggregated data like in AxxonSoft.\\\\
The product will interact with the larger system of distributed IoT sensors utilizing the 
MQTT protocol to protect the data and ensure system privacy and security. SCEMAS will act 
as a central ingestion hub, receiving high-volume telemetry streams from sensors to detect 
threshold violations in real-time. The product will also utilize real-world mapping 
software such as OpenStreetMap or GoogleMaps to visualize these telemetry streams. Similar 
to AxxonSoft map view, SCEMAS will overlay live heatmaps and alert markers on the geography, 
allowing City Officials to pinpoint the exact location of environmental hazards and acknowledge 
them directly from the map interface.\\\\
The product will have a sub-system to export data for public use, using a secure getaway 
allowing the city to share non-sensitive environmental information to an external public 
facing website and a read-only API. This website will be open to the public and will have 
a heatmap on limited metrics. This ensures City Officials have full command-and-control 
capabilities of public facing data.

% End SubSection

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
The system functionality will be focused on both data collection and processing done 
automatically as well as interactions between users and the system. At a high level, the 
system is responsible for collecting environmental data, storing this data, calculating 
aggregations of data series by city zone, and comparing stored alert configurations to 
present data. The city operators and administrators can interact with this system through 
a dashboard interface while public users can use a public facing API that provides different 
functionality from the city dashboard. An important property of the system is that it has 
functionality to authenticate users and limit the access of different users based on their role. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |m{2in}|m{4.5in}| } 
 \hline
 \bf{Function} & \bf{Description} \\ 
 \hline
 Environmental Data Collection & The system collects data from many sensors throughout a city. The system ensures the incoming data is in the correct format, within bounds, and valid before accepting it. \\ 
 \hline
 Data Storage and Management & Sensor data is stored for real-time and historical use, organized by time and stored by city zone. \\ 
 \hline
 Data Processing and Aggregation & Data is aggregated over time and by city zone for both private use and public access depending on the sensitivity of the data.  \\ 
 \hline
 Alert Detection and Management & Administrators can manage and add new alert rules. Alerts occur when real time data triggers the rule of an alert. Alerts are logged and notifications are sent to the dashboard \\ 
 \hline
 Dashboard for City Operators & The dashboard is a secure interface for city operators to view real time data, current alerts, and view trends.  \\ 
 \hline
 Public Data Access Interface & A read-only public interface is exposed which only allows access to aggregated, non-sensitive environmental data. \\ 
 \hline
 RBAC Management & The system supports Role-Based Access Control to differentiate administrators from city operators.  \\ 
 \hline
 Authentication & All user sign-ins are authenticated and all data in transit is encrypted. All significant events, such as alert triggers and administrative changes, are logged by the system.  \\

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
% Begin SubSection
As the app will have different interfaces for different types of users, it is important for us 
to define the distinct needs and abilities of each category of user.\\\\
\textbf{City Operators}\\
City operators will be responsible for monitoring the application's dashboard to put out alerts for events.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Educational level:} Secondary school education
		\begin{itemize}
			\item City operators are expected to have at least a high-school level of education to properly interpret the data on the dashboard.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Experience:} Prior training in using the system
		\begin{itemize}
			\item City operators are expected to be trained in how to use the dashboard prior to starting their role. Prior experience in using a similar dashboard would also be acceptable experience.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Technical experience:} Average computer knowledge
		\begin{itemize}
			\item City operators are expected to have a medium level of expertise in using computers, including an understanding of file systems and more complex graphical user interfaces.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{City Residents}\\
City residents will view city-wide alerts notifications from a different interface than city operators.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Educational level:} Basic reading and comprehension ability
		\begin{itemize}
			\item City residents fall into a wide range of age and education levels, so in order to best accommodate the target audience, the application should be accessible to those with only a primary school education level. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Experience:} None
		\begin{itemize}
			\item City residents should be able to learn to use the app without having any prior experience with it, or similar products. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Technical experience:} Minimal understanding of computers
		\begin{itemize}
			\item City residents are expected to have a minimal understanding of how computers work in order to launch the application, as well as some understanding of common app navigation methods (e.g. basic menus, buttons)
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Application Administrators}\\
Administrators will be able to define alert rules for the city operator dashboard.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Educational level:} Post-Secondary education
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The administrators of the system are expected to have completed a four year program at a university or college relating to city management or administrative systems. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Experience:} Prior training in using the system
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The application administrators of the system are expected to have prior training in using the system, as well as prior experience in using similar software.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Technical experience:} Mid-High level of computer knowledge
		\begin{itemize}
			\item System admins are expected to have a mid to high understanding of computers, and should have a good understanding of file systems, complex system interfaces, trouble-shooting, and potentially command-line interfacing.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The app should also be accessible to individuals with varying levels of visual, auditory and mobility impairments on all user-facing-interfaces to ensure it is usable for all members of the general population. 
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
The following are constraints which may limit the developer's options and approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textbf{Communication Protocol:} The system must accept and send all environmental telemetry data using the MQTT protocol. This is mandated by the existing IoT infrastructure already deployed in smart city environments. The system cannot use alternative protocols such as HTTP.
	\item[] \textbf{Regulation Compliance:} The system must comply with all data protection and privacy regulations, such as the PIPEDA in Canada. 
	\item[] \textbf{Public Data Access:} Only non-sensitive environmental data should be exposed through the public interface. Any sensitive data must be restricted for authorized users. This constraint stems from the privacy-by-design requirement specified in the system design.
	\item[] \textbf{Budget Constraint:} The system must be developed and deployed with zero monetary budget. All software tools, cloud services, databases, and third-party APIs must utilize free-tier offerings.
	\item[] \textbf{Fixed Timeline:} The system must be developed within the time allocated. This fixed deadline constrains the scope of features that can be implemented and requires prioritization of core functionality over advanced features.
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We are a private company being contracted by the city government to create this platform. 
	\item The project is assumed to be funded by the Government of Canada.
	\item The system is assumed to be limited to operation within one city.
	\item It is assumed that there is valid data flowing into the system from various IoT devices for Business Events to be successful (as stated in the Precondition for BE1).
	\item It is assumed that accompanying training modules will be provided for City Operators, and they can read the system documentation.

\section{Highlights of Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:functional_requirements}
% Begin Section
\begin{itemize}
	\item Specify all use cases (or other scenarios triggered by other events), organized by Business Event. 
	\item For each Business Event, show the scenario from every Viewpoint. You should have the same set of Viewpoints across all Business Events. If a Viewpoint doesn't participate, write N/A so we know you considered it still. You can choose how to present this - keep in mind it should be easy to follow. 
	\item At the end, combine them all into a Global Scenario.
	%\item Specify the "use cases" (or other triggering events) organized by Business Event. (The Global Scenario is what you might think of as a use case). Be sure to consider Business Events that aren't just triggered by users with goals (e.g. something happens in the environment that your system needs to respond to)
	\item Your focus should be on what the system needs to do, not how to do it. Specify it in enough detail that it clearly specifies what needs to be accomplished, but not so detailed that you start programming or making design decisions.
	\item Keep the length of each use case (Global Scenario) manageable. If it's getting too long, split into sub-cases.
	\item You are \emph{not} specifying a complete and consistent set of functional requirements here. (i.e. you are providing them in the form of use cases/global scenarios, not a refined list). For the purpose of this project, you do not need to reduce them to a list; the global scenarios format is all you need.
	\item Red text below is just to highlight where you need to insert a scenario - don't actually write it all in red.
\end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf Main Business Events:} List out all the main business events you are presenting. If you sub-divided into smaller ones, you don't need to include the smaller ones in this list.\\

\noindent {\bf Viewpoints:} List out all the viewpoints you will be considering.\\

\noindent {\bf Interpretation:} Specify any liberties you took in interpreting business events, if necessary.\\

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:non-functional_requirements}


\begin{itemize}
	\item For each non-functional requirement, provide a justification/rationale for it.\\
	{\bf Example:} \\
	SC1. \emph{The device should not explode in a customer’s pocket.}\\
	{\bf Rationale:} Other companies have had issues with the batteries they used in their phones randomly exploding [insert citation]. This causes a safety issue, as the phone is often carried in a person's hand or pocket.	
	\item If you need to make a guess because you couldn't really talk to stakeholders, you can say "We imagined stakeholders would want...because..."
	\item Each requirement should have a unique label/number for it.
	\item In the list below, if a particular section doesn't apply, just write N/A so we know you considered it.
